This project was created for a Computer Engineering Technology Capstone class at Conestoga College.
This project Connects to the stm32l475 board. The board itself has wireless communication but is not yet used in this program
Currently this board outputs a PWM to control a motor.
The whole project is too big to upload to a single file so included are the main files included under the Src file in the project Directory.
